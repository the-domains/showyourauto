equipped 4spd, Dana 60 Super Track Pack, Concours Gold Mopar Nats 2010.  The 440 SIX PACK convertible was chosen to introduce the now legendary Challenger name in 1970. Of the 99 produced, 61 were equipped with a manual transmission, and only a handful, mostly the PR cars and this one, were optioned with the mighty Super Track Pack. For years Mopar enthusiasts believed that no 440 SIX PACK Challenger R/T&#x27;s were sold outside the United States. The emergence and authentication of this car forced Chrysler historian and subject matter expert, Galen Govier, to set the record straight. This is the ONLY 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T 440 SIX PACK convertible Chrysler produced for export outside the U.S.  According to Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Transportation, this B5 Blue, white interior beauty sold new to Hector Antonio on September 16th, 1970 for $4,100.01. It stayed in the same extended family in Puerto Rico from 1970 to 2006. As it changed hands between family members, it also changed colors, from the original Blue over White, to Red over White, to Red over Black, and lastly Black over Black. It was discovered in \&quot;barn find\&quot; condition by a Florida man who was blown away by how complete and intact the car still was despite the color change. All the original sheet metal was there as was the original drivetrain, dash tag, fender tag, and door sticker. He repatriated the car, the Challenger touching the U.S. main land for the first time since 1970. There she remained for a short time, still in unrestored condition.  The current owner commissioned Galen Govier to conduct a complate Visual Inspection prior to restoration in 2006 as a condition. Here is a summary of his findings:  Â \&quot;On your 1970 Model Year vehicle, there are 6 VINâs that determine âNumbers Matchingâ plus the door VIN decal, but only if it is an original decal. ITEM FINDINGS  Dash VIN. Verified as correct with correct rivets. Primary body codes. Verified as correct found on the back of the radiator support. Secondary body codes.
